#summary Initialization instructions -- How to get started.

= Initialization Instructions =

We describe here three scenarios.

== Simple installation, 1GB database == 

 * Compile the code
 * Go into directory src/Tool_DataPath/executable
 * run "./dp" and answer the questions -- this initializes the system
  * What is the page muliplier exponent of the array?
   * 1 -- this is always the best option for spindle disks. Only large SSDs need 2-3
  * The disk array can use multiple stripes. How many stripes should we use?
   * 1 -- use only one disk/stripe
  * Pattern for the stripes fies. 
   * stripe -- this creates a file called stripe that has the data
  * At this point the database is created.
 * run "./dp Queries/TPCH-1G/types.dp" 
  * this tells the system about the data types
 * run "./dp Queries/TPCH-1G/tpch.dp" 
  * this tels the system about the TPC-H schema
 * to generate *.tbl tables using dbgen do "./dbgen -s 1"
