/** This header defines an abstract class specifying the interface for IDs
		This class does not implement anything, it is a pure interface specification

		Here are the assumptions made when specifying this interface:
		1. The IDs will be placed into containers but not heterogeneous containers.
		   For example, you can have a container of WaypointsID but not a mixed container
			 of WaypointIDs and QueryIDs.

		2. All ID behave like a small identifier and they can be copied easily around
		   This means that all copy constructors and = operator are allowed and are efficient

    3. The IDs have to be efficient. Most of the time, information is not requested about
		   them (this can be a little inefficient) but the usage as an index in a map has
			 to be efficient

			copy constructor:
