// this is an int-to-int map (well, it's actually an HT_INDEX_TYPE-to-unsigned int map) that
// is implemented as a simple, non-self-balancing binary tree.  To guard against really bad 
// behaviour when keys are inserted in order, it indexes based upon a hashed value of the key,
// rather than the key itself.  It is thread-safe as long as not more than one writer uses it
// at the same time.  Furthermore, it is efficient in the way it allocates memory, doing it 
// a block-at-a-time.  This map is used by hash table segments to externally store offsets 
// that are more than 10 bits.  Finally, the implementation assumes that keys which are queried
// for will ALWAYS be there, and that we'll never insert the same key twice.
