/** \file
 *  This C header file was generated by $ANTLR version 3.3 Nov 30, 2010 12:50:56
 *
 *     -  From the grammar source file : Piggy.g
 *     -                            On : 2012-06-14 15:15:16
 *     -                 for the lexer : PiggyLexerLexer *
 * Editing it, at least manually, is not wise. 
 *
 * C language generator and runtime by Jim Idle, jimi|hereisanat|idle|dotgoeshere|ws.
 *
 *
 * The lexer PiggyLexer has the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 * 
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
 *
 * The parser entry points are called indirectly (by function pointer to function) via
 * a parser context typedef pPiggyLexer, which is returned from a call to PiggyLexerNew().
 *
 * As this is a generated lexer, it is unlikely you will call it 'manually'. However
 * the methods are provided anyway.
 * * The methods in pPiggyLexer are  as follows:
 *
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->LOAD(pPiggyLexer)
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->READ(pPiggyLexer)
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->USING(pPiggyLexer)
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->FROM(pPiggyLexer)
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->BY(pPiggyLexer)
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->STORE(pPiggyLexer)
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->AS(pPiggyLexer)
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->TO(pPiggyLexer)
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->INTO(pPiggyLexer)
 *  -  void      pPiggyLexer->Tokens(pPiggyLexer)
 *
 * The return type for any particular rule is of course determined by the source
 * grammar file.
