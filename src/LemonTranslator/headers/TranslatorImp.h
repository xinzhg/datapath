/* Translator object that gets instructions in the high level language
	 and comes up with the instructions for the entire system. The
	 translator will do the following things:

	 1. Figure out how to update the DataPathGraph
	 2. Generate code for all waypoints that changed 
	 3. Generate instructions for file scanners for all new queries
	 4. Compile the code and make it available in a shared directory

	 A single message is sent to the Coordinator with all the info when
	 queries change. A separate message is send for each "run"
	 command. If queries are to be executed simultaneously, make sure
	 they are all listed under a single "run".

	 NOTE: the translator does not talk directly to the file scanners
	 and has a WayPointID associated with them instead of a
	 TableScanID. The conversion has to be done by the Coordinator or
	 Executin engine.

	 NEED: add "dot" plotting capabilities to LemonGraph

	 NOTE: Should the Attribute manager be a part of the translator
	 instead of being global?
