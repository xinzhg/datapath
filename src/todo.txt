All iterators need to remember start positions (curPosInCOlumn) so that
storage can directly jump to that point.

BitStringIterator need to remember end counter as well, so that we can end
safely.

We need to make shallow copies of all iterators and then pass this jumping
information. We can not just pass everything in constructors, because once
column is swapped with one of them, we cannt create others ! So support good
shallow copy of all iterators.

All metadata will be in memory, but now need to store information about slices
as well.

We need to process one slice at once, we dont need to subpartition within
slices.

In writer, once we get all LHS or RHS chunks, then start launching slices of
them.
