/** Class to implement the mid-level File access.
		Its main job is to coordinate the reading and the writing of chunks

		The actual I/O is performed through a DiskArray (the global disk
		array for now).

		The class needs to both read and write chunks since the hard drive
		drivers can only talk to a single higher task. Also this solves a
		lot of headakes with making sure that the higher tasks know about
		writes as well as reads.

		The class is designed to do asynchronous reads and writes. Nothing
		blocks while the requests are pending and the higher file scanner
		code gets notified when a job is done.

		Since some tasks might require very few pages, the order of
		finishing the jobs might be different than the order of the
		requests. It is the job of the higher part to reorder the
		accnoledgements if it so desrires (this part acts like the IP
		layer in TCP/IP).

		On Reading, the class creates chunks so it does all the heavy
		lifting in terms of memory allocation and initialization. This is
		why this class should be asynchronous and allow multi-threading.
