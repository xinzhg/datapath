This directory contains the M4 modules used to generate the functions
needed by each waypoint. For each waypoint there is a file called:
Waypoint.cc.m4 that contains the main module definition of that waypoint. 

Normally, the code generator would load all the definitions of modules
and then call the module initialization macros to define functions for
each waypoint. The file AllDefs.m4 should include all the parts needed
in order to compile any code. This file should be kept up to date when
more waypoints are added.

This directory shuld contain mostly cc-like code. All the tedious M4
macros should be provided in the M4/ directory.

To get things compiled:
1. The Attribute manager has to produce "Attributes.m4"
2. The Query manager has to produce "Queries.m4"
3. The Code generator has to produce "Main.m4"

make then will produce a library called: "GenCode.so" that can be
loaded dynamically.


The file "Main.m4" has to look like this:
--------------------
include(Modules.m4)

M4_CODE_GENERATION_PREAMBLE

M4_SELECTION_MODULE(Wp1, ...)

M4_JOIN_MODULE(Wp5, ...)
...
