/**
	Class to implement message passing between threads that suppoprts
	multiple message types simultaneously.

	The class is intended to have a single reader that wayts for multiple
	types of messaes simultaneously and multiple readers.

	The class has to be thread safe. There is no limit to the size of the queue
	implemented.

	The class is designed to manipulate only messages, not data. The
	only assumption the class makes is that only one thread works on a
	message at a time (assumption about usage of messages).

	The messages are created by the writer and distroied by the
	reader. Only refferences are passed around.

	MultiMessageQueue does not look at the messages, just keeps track of their
	type.
