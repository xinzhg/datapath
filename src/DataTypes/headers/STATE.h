/** Type definition for generic GLA states. This type is only used to
    trannsport states withing the same memory space between
    operators. The object the state points to MUST be treated like a
    const.

    Note: this type cannot be read from the disk or written to the
    output. A different mechanism will be used for that.

    The type in the object must be a hash of the name of the class
    used to encode the object. Any function that assumes a certain
    type must explicitly verify the correctness of the type.

    The object can be manipulated like a basic datatype. STATE objects
    do not know how to deallocate the memory they use. Other
    mechanisms have to be used to ensure correct deallocation
    (acknowledgements of data packets that contain this as members).
