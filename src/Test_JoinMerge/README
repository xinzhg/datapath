To run this test, first modify the Makefile generated by Makefile_prelude so add Generated.so path as linker option, Add ./Test_JoinMerge/executable/Generated.so in LINKFLAGS

make (make sure Generated.so is already created)

cd to executable directory and issue generate.sh (this will create Generated.so)

- Now run
> ./Test_JoinMerge/executable/JoinMerge
> This needs to be run from src directory because we gave path in linker as relative path

Here is the logic of the code w.r.t queries
- Extract all columns whose queries (provided by translator) matches the queries of the waypoint. Otherwise don't work on that columns for which there is no query in the WP
- Then create a heap data structure, and fill at least one entry in the heap for each column. These will be first entries to start with. The first entry from the column is chosen if their bitstring shows some active query matching with the WP queries. We are not checking here if bitstring queries intersects with the translator provided queries? SHould we?
