/** hash function.

	* Can be called like CongruentHash(x) or like
	* CongruentHash(x, chain)
	* the second form is used for hashing more than a long by
	* chaining calls of the hash

	Universal Hash = (ax+b)mod p
	Computing ax+b is straight forward. Computing mod needs to be well thought efficient operation.
	We select our constants a and b in such a way that we need less mod operations (only one). And
	of course we do not compute mod using division. There are several papers which talks about
	doing mod in a very simple way (just adding hi and lo bits). One such paper is by David G Carta.
	Though it talks about PRNG (pseudo number generator with full cycle period), but we can relate
	few things to our hashing problem too. hi+lo only works if we have mersenne prime.

	Value of p we choose is mersenne prime, 2^k - 1, and luckily 2^61-1 is the one we need.

	What David Carta say is, we can write ax+b = 2^61 hi + lo. And our modulo p would be
	hi + lo,               if (hi + lo < 2^61) OR
	hi + lo - 2^61 + 1     if (hi + lo >= 2^61) which essentially is another modulo to remove overflow

	SS: One website I would like to mention which consolidates several papers and comparisions b/w them
	    www.firstpr.com.au/dsp/rand31/#PRB69
			which explains the modulo nicely, here is explaination which is simpler than what David Carta explains.

			"Lets define some labels:

			lo = 61 bits 60 to 0.
			hi = rest of the high order bits

			multiplication product (ax + b) would be in the form:

				lo
			+ (hi * 0x2000000000000000)

			Observe that this is the same as:

			lo
		+ (hi * 0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
		+ (hi * 0x0000000000000001)


			However, we don't need or want big result. We only want that result mod(0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). Therefore we can
			ignore the middle line and use for our intermediate result:

			lo
		+ hi

			This potentially 62 bit value still needs to be subjected to a mod(0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) operation to produce
			the final pseudo-random result.

			Because of the nature of the hi and lo bits, and the nature of the modulus constant, the modulus operation can
			be done with a simple bit 62 test and the only action which may need to be taken is to subtract a single
			instance of the modulus constant. It suffices to test bit 62, and if it is set, to zero it and increment the
			remaining bits, which are guaranteed not to overflow.  This is subtracting 0x2000000000000000 and adding 1."


	The constants a and b we have chosen makes sure that we do not exceed 122 bits in our multiplication
	Hence we choose 48 bits constants. The choice of constants do matter a lot, to acheive full cycle behavior
	if we talk about random number generation by using previous hash value. And we do have known
	constants for 2^31 - 1 case, but there is no research for Linear congruent generators for 64 bit case.
	Hence for now, we just choose any 48 bit H_a and H_b, since our problem is little different too. Just
	hope we don't find any collisions! Else, just find some good constants.

	Usually in research papers, they talk about minimal standard which means, constants which
	are small as possible are proven to show good behavior than the larger ones. Minimal standard
	would mean smallest possible constants which shows full cycle behavior when feed with just
	initial seed and then use previous results to compute next. For all possible initial seeds,
	it should be full cycle behavior to gurantee minimal standard.

	This hash shown to be 10 times faster than system modulo % operator, with below test

	int main(void){
  	Timer clock;
  	clock.Restart();
 	 	__uint64_t val=H_b;
 	 	for (int i = 0; i < 1000000000UL; i++)
 	  	 val = CongruentHash(i, val);
 	 	double time = clock.GetTime();
		cout << time;

  What we are doing below is writing y = hi*2^61 + lo since then
  y mod p = (hi + lo) mod p which is at most 1 p over
