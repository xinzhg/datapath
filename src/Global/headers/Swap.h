	This header contains macro definitions to streamline the swapping of data.
	The main macro defined is SWAP(a,b) that swaps the content of a and b as
	long as they are of the same type and they support the = operator.

	Notice that the type of the a and b is not passed and it is infered using typeof()
	operator.
