/** Waypoint that reads plain text and builds chunks.

		Capabilities:
		1. Can work in parallel from many files
		2. Aggressive so that a lot of work is done simultaneously
    3. Can skip columns (addapts to the query plan)

    Limitations:
		1. Cannot support dropped chunks for now
		   This is due to the fact hat pipes cannot be rewind so a
		complicated dance involving caching chunks needs to be used (a
		chunk is let go only when a confirmation of it's processing is
		obtained). This seems to be unavoidable with pipes.
