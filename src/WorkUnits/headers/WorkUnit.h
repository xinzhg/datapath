/**
	* Class WorkUnit is an interface specification class for all work units

	* Only the interface provided in this class can be used inside the Scheduler.

	* Each work unit belongs to a WayPoint that needs to get it back
	* when it is executed. A type, which is WayPoint specific, can be
	* specified as well to help the WayPoint manage it better.

	* Any state changed by the WorkUnit and any output produced can be extracted
	* only by the WayPoint that knows how to create/use these type fo WorkUnits

	* The work units live only termporarily outside the WayPoint that
	* created them and they are not passed arround except for execution

	* Assumptions:
	* 1. The WorkUnit assumes that the method Run is executed only once
	* 		and that it is always executed once the WorkUnit is created
	* 2. The WorkUnit assumes that it is given back the the crator WayPoint
	* 		to extract the results.
