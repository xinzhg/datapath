	// of the acceptable segments, clone it, and give it back to you, putting it into
	// checkMeOut.  At this point, you lock out any other writers from writing to the hash
	// table segment, until it goes out of scope and the destructor is called.  Note that

	// already been checked out before Replace is called; this ensures that there are no other
