This directory contains all the source files that are a mix of SQL and
C++. These files are translated first into C++ then compiled. By
isolating the files here, the use of SQL in the system is confined and
kept under control.

The files in this directory have -SQL attached to the name and the
extra extension m4. To ensure they are compiled into the project, the
object *-SQL.o must be specified in the Makefiles.
