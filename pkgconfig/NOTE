This directory is for pkg-config meta-data files for libraries that are
missing them.

I can't guarantee that these files will work on all systems, so you should
install them somewhere and modify them if they contain incorrect information.
Generally, you should only have to modify the four variables at the beginning
of the file to point to the correct install location of the library on your
system.
